SCALAK
======

Scalak is simple (yet potentially powerful) integrated development
environment. Designed for small and medium open source projects, as 
well as, projects within classes, especially for those using Agile 
methodologies - Scrum in particular, but it should do for any one You like. 

Scalak is Trac based system, written in Python running under control of Apache,
web interface is implemented using Pylons. It is using MySql for storage,
but it should be
possible to change it (fairly easily), to any kind of relational DBMS, as long
as there is Python DB-API for it.

Scalak is designed to be light-weight and *pythonic*, thanks to modular 
architecture it is easy to extend and adjust - it should scale well to.
